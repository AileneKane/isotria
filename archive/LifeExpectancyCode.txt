## Form a transition matrix, here it is called INSTANT, and it is a 8 x 8 matrix.

## Using popbio-package, form the fundamental matrix N

N.ins = fundamental.matrix(INSTANT) 

## The fundamental matrix or mean of the time spent in each stage class (you could get variances as well, N.ins$var)

N.ins$N    


## Vector of ones (8, because the transition matrix is 8 x 8)
e.one =as.matrix(c(rep(1,8)))

## Taking the column sum of the fundamental matrix which are the mean life times for plants in a given stage (see Caswell 2001)
life.ins =as.vector(t(e.one)%*%N.ins$N)
